# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this. I am making my baby steps with git and github. Please do not hesitate to reach me at dalidaseb@gmail.com whenever you would like to contribute to this project.


## Testing

Feel free to test code or make comment wherever improvement should be and even suggest better coding examples.

## Submitting changes

Please send a pull request with a clear list of what you've done. When you send a pull request.Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

  * We indent using two spaces (soft tabs)
  * We ALWAYS put spaces after list items and method parameters (`[1, 2, 3]`, not `[1,2,3]`), around operators (`x += 1`, not `x+=1`), and around hash arrows.
  * This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. It's sort of like driving a car: Perhaps you love doing donuts when you're alone, but with passengers the goal is to make the ride as smooth as possible.

Thanks,
